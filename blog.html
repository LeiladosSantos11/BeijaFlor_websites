                        <p>When it comes to design, less is more. But with so many choices for colors, fonts, images,
                            and
                            icons, it’s easy to go overboard.</p>
                        <p>So how do you optimize your website design? Lucky for you, that’s our expertise! Here are a
                            few
                            tips to follow in order to get designer results from your website:</p>

                        <p><strong>Stick to 1-2 colors on your site</strong></p>

                        <p>Have you noticed that websites from your favourite brands? How many of them have more than 2
                            primary
                            colours?? Exactly! When designing your brand, you don’t want to confuse the message that
                            you’re
                            trying to send. Colours affect our moods and consequently our choices on how we interact
                            with a
                            brand. Whatever feeling you’re trying to get from your potential client / customer, make
                            sure
                            that
                            it’s clear and reflected in your choice of colour.</p>
                        <p><strong>Use only 2-3 fonts</strong> </p>
                        <p>Similar to colour, the type of font that is used on your website (and any marketing for that
                            matter)
                            affects the perception of your brand. If you are in an industry where clients need you to be
                            reliable, it may be best to stick with less artistic fonts. Having several different fonts
                            all
                            over
                            your site will make the text look incoherent, as if it was put together by several different
                            people.</p>
                        <p><strong>Put enough white space between photos and text</strong></p>
                        <p>The items on your website need to be scannable - i.e. your target market needs to be able to
                            clearly
                            differentiate between the information that they do and don’t want. Not every visitor to your
                            site
                            will read every page in depth. In fact, many will scan the page to gauge the mood before
                            they
                            decide
                            whether or not to engage with your brand.</p>
